# Contributing to TTS VSCode Extension

ðŸŽ‰ Right off! Thank you for looking into contributing! ðŸŽ‰

You can help us improve the TTS VSCode Extension by contributing to the project in any way you can. We would love to have your help!

The following is a bit of information that could help you jump right in and help contributing to TTS VSCode Extension. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. If anything even this file can be improved, just submit a PR for it.

For starters you can check out the list of good first issues [here](https://github.com/rolandostar/tabletopsimulator-lua-vscode/contribute) and the list of all issues [here](https://github.com/rolandostar/tabletopsimulator-lua-vscode/issues).

My recommendation is to dive into the code with a goal in mind (like a bug or small feature), and whenever something is unclear, you can reach out via discord and ask for help, or if you'd rather have an open discussion that's possible too, just open up a new issue and we can chat there. I will be more than happy to help you out.

### Documentation

Well right now, the documentation is a bit lacking. Any help in improving the documentation is much welcomed. You can help by writing new pages, fixing typos or even just pointing out where the documentation is lacking in a new issue.

Documentation is written in markdown and is located in the `docs/content` directory. And is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). This is published to [https://tts-vscode.rolandostar.com/](https://tts-vscode.rolandostar.com/) with a GitHub Action on every tagged push.

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug in the project you can help out by opening an issue in the repository. To make it easier to reproduce the bug, please provide as much information as possible. This could include:
 - The version of the project you are using.
 - The steps to reproduce the bug.
 - Any error messages you are receiving.
 - Expected/Unexpected behavior.

I often include error messages for debugging or for weird I-thought-it-couldn't-happen-but-it-did situations. If you are comfortable with it, you can include the error messages in the issue by opening the developer console in your editor and copying the error message from there.

### Suggesting Enhancements

If you have an idea to make the project better, you can open an issue in the repository. To make it easier to understand your enhancement, please provide as much information as possible. This could include:
 - The current behavior.
 - The expected behavior.
 - A possible solution.

Weird ideas are welcome! If you have an idea that you think is weird, just open an issue and we can discuss it. It might be a good idea after all. ðŸ˜„
