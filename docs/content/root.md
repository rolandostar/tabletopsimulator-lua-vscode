# Documentation Intro

Hello there ðŸ‘‹

And welcome, this is the documentation for the Tabletop Simulator Lua extension for VSCode. This application is currently actively maintained and is being developed by [rolandostar](https://discord.com/users/90207880464076800) (Additional contact links at the bottom of this page).

## Getting Started

Check the [Setup](extension/setup) page for instructions on how to get started with the extension. Then check the [Extension](extension) section for a list of features and how to use them. And finally check the [FAQ](faq) page for answers to common questions.

If you want to, check out the [Guides](guides) section for some guides on how to use the extension.

## About

This project was motivated on trying out different solutions to communicate VSCode with TTS and being rather unsuccessful at that. I tried using [OliPro007's Extension](https://github.com/OliPro007/tabletopsimulator-lua-vscode) and was a bit finicky for me, I also checked out [dustinlacewell's vatts](https://github.com/dustinlacewell/vatts) and was able to retrieve scripts but not send them. I guess I'm just inexperienced setting up these extensions which is why I wanted to dive into it by making my own and hoped to streamline the process for someone else.

I kind of ended up doing my own thing.

If you have any suggestions feel free to contact me or submit a PR.
